# LinkedIn Clone

Link to deployed app: https://linkedin-clone-a0247.web.app 

## Description

This is a LinkedIn clone built with React, Redux and Firebase's NoSQL cloud database and Authentication. It allows users to create an account, login, and post messages. Users can also logout by pressing their profile image in the top right hand corner. Redux has been used to store the user's information - it keeps tabs on whether the user is logged in or out. The messages are stored on Cloud Firestore (NoSQL database) and are displayed on the home page - they are updated and shown in real time. This project was built via a tutorial by [Sonny Sangha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbvguOj8C-o&t=17920s&ab_channel=SonnySangha) on YouTube.
